This is a demo application built to showcase the capabilities of 
- spring-boot
- spring-statemachine
- spring-data-jpa
- spring-web

The advantage with state-machine processing is that systems like order processing management, stock and inventory control need the processing to happen in a finite state processing model with fine grained control over state to state transition. 

The processing in such systems does not happen synchronously unlike in web-applications. 

The state-machine model of processing gives a fine grained control over state transitions and their propogation model.
